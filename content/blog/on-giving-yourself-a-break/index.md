Last night, my washing machine broke down. I wanted to quickly wash a sweater that I’ve been wearing a lot recently so I could let it dry overnight. At least, that’s what I thought when I turned the thing on at 10 pm. It was supposed to be a quick 60-minute program. When I went to check how many minutes were left on the machine almost an hour later, I saw an error code on the screen. “You better not break down on me!” I said out loud, as if the machine could hear me. I knew it, the thing didn’t work. I opened the door, and my sweater was drenched in water. I could feel my anger stirring inside.

First I took the sweater to my bathtub and started centrifuging the thing with my hands, like a cowboy in an old Western washing his shirt in the river.. As I was wringing the sweater, I was surprised by how heavy it was on my forearms. I actually thought, “This is a good workout,” and felt pretty good about it for a moment. But after doing it for a while, and realizing it takes a long time to get the water out of the cotton, I started getting annoyed. “Why does this happen right now? Why not during the day?”

I squeezed enough so the sweater didn’t drip water anymore, and hung it to dry. Then I went back to the washing machine and in my stubbornness, set out to find the problem. I wanted to fix the damn machine right there, right then, and started pulling it apart. By the time I was finished, it was midnight, I was sweating profusely, and I was pumped up from the adrenaline caused by my anger. This whole episode was totally trivial. Stuff like this happens all the time. We all experience anger in some shape or form. For me, it often comes when things don’t do what they are supposed to, like my washing machine that doesn’t want to wash. In the end, the problem was fixed, but at what cost?

Seneca explained the importance of managing anger: “Anger, if not restrained, is frequently more hurtful to us than the injury that provokes it.” This isn’t just emotionally true; there are physical implications too.

When you’re angry or when you beat yourself up because you’re so critical of yourself (which is a form of anger towards yourself), you release cortisol. This isn’t only bad for your body, it’s also bad for your sleep. Cortisol is the primary stress hormone of the human body, and it increases sugars in the bloodstream so your brain operates better during life and death situations. It’s a great biological process that likely once saved us from saber-toothed tigers, but it also has the power to destroy us when we get stressed about meaningless things. Cortisol slows down your metabolism, which can seriously disrupt your digestive system. 2000 years ago, Seneca probably didn’t know about the science of cortisol, but he could feel the negative impact anger and stress had.

Let’s be real: Every time you get angry, you’re only harming yourself. The things that make you angry are often less hurtful than the effect of anger on your body. That doesn’t mean you should never get angry. Go ahead and get angry when someone threatens your livelihood. But don’t get angry with yourself when something goes wrong, or when you do something wrong in your own eyes. So many of us treat ourselves with anger, that we can use more self-love. Go easy on yourself.

After the whole washing machine episode, I had to laugh because it was so stupid. I stood there sweaty, at 12 am, fixing a washing machine, while I should’ve been in bed. I also thought, “At least this experience wasn’t meaningless because I can write about it.” The better response would be to laugh right at the moment I found a drenched sweater in the washing machine, but you know what they say: Better late than never.

> *Instead of beating yourself up and being your own antagonist, be your own comedian. Observe your behavior, and instead of getting angry, become aware of the shortness of life, realize that most things are not worth getting angry over, and laugh it off. Life will be better that way. All the best.*
