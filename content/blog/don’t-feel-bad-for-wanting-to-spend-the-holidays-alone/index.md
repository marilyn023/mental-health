I didn’t want to go home.

The trips were miserable. If I wasn’t scrubbing my mom’s bodily fluids out of the carpet, I was enduring my dad’s judgment. If I said hi, he responded by commenting openly on my hair, my clothes, and of course my *body*. It wasn’t unusual to spend an afternoon in the ER.

When I moved out, I considered myself free of all that. I was fine being the feckless daughter who abandoned her family to go off and chase her wild dreams. Part of me was afraid that if I ever returned home, even for a couple of days, I’d never leave again.

It still gives me nightmares.

Thomas Wolfe said, “You can’t go home again.” The idea is that home is a time and a memory, not a place.

I didn’t get either.

# Nobody lets us be alone.

After a bad breakup, I moved to a different city and started a PhD program. For the first time, I learned how to be truly alone.

I rented a studio apartment.

There was this newfound quiet. No family to take care of. No friends or roommates to distract me. No love interest.

I could finally think.

Around then, I started going on dates with myself. I went out to eat by myself. I had coffee by myself. I went on long, long walks in the woods. I got back into running. Over the weeks and months, it became clear that I’d never invested anytime in getting to know the person inside me.

One time, a friend saw me at a movie.

He smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone I saw you here alone.” He was only half kidding.

I told him I didn’t care.

He squinted.

# The holidays pressure us to connect.

Here’s a Hallmark formula:

A successful young woman plans to enjoy a subdued Christmas, either by herself or with some friends. A guardian angel swoops in to show her everything wrong with that, including her wilted relationships with estranged family members. Everyone makes it *her* responsibility to repair these relationships, to discover some vague meaning.

Every year, Hallmark makes hundreds of millions of dollars off selling peer pressure and guilt to young women.

The young person *must* conform*.*

Maybe the biggest myth of all is that you can never, ever, *ever* spend a Thanksgiving or Christmas or Hanukkah by yourself. The Christmas industrial complex won’t allow it. It makes you “sad.” Advertisers and mainstream media push normative values at us 24/7 for two months solid, and they wonder why depression and drinking spike.

Maybe it’s all the shaming?

Even the most eccentric families in Christmas movies have nothing on the families I know. The script holds a safety net under the viewers, to make sure nothing resembles real life *too* much.

Nothing ever gets *too* dark.

One of my friends went home for Christmas, only to be given a wedding dress as a present. She wasn’t engaged.

Her mom told her, “You’re running out of time.”

In real life, there’s no soundtrack or supporting cast to bail you out. It’s just you sitting there holding a wedding dress while your family judges you. I have another friend whose family made her sit at the kid’s table every Thanksgiving because she was “still single.” They also put meat in everything, even the beans, even though she’s a vegan.

Tell me it’s worse to be alone.

# Yes, spending holidays alone is scary.

Once or twice, I did manage to summon the guts to cancel a bad holiday. One year I got up right in the middle of Christmas dinner. My dad broke off his running list of my defects and asked where I was going.

I told him I was driving home.

*My* home.

I told him I’d rather be anywhere else in the world than sitting there, listening to him insult me over cornbread dressing.

That was a tough couple of days. I didn’t know what to do with myself. My apartment building was apocalyptically quiet. The streets were emptier than I’d ever seen. It looked like purgatory.

At first I felt sorry for myself.

Then I started doing some things *I* wanted. I went for a run. I watched a play. I read a little. I had some wine. I took a bath. It occurred to me that around the country, millions of people were spending time with family out of some misplaced sense of obligation. Millions of others were brooding because they were alone, simply because society had fed them a message that being alone on a holiday made them a loser.

It doesn’t.

# You deserve to be alone.

My dad got the message, loud and clear.

He doesn’t insult me anymore.

He learned a valuable lesson, that you can’t assume family will stick around just *because*. You can’t rely on cultural conditioning. After a certain point, someone does prefer to be alone on the holidays. They’ll endure the stigma, because it frees them.

*The world is filled with people who put up with abuse and neglect simply because they fear being alone, because we learn to see solitude as a disease. It’s not. Solitude can be independence.*

Since then, I’ve married into a big family. I’ve got in-laws I actually look forward to seeing over the holidays. Still, my favorite times are when I can escape to be off by myself.

They get it.

You’re not a failure if you’re alone on the holidays. You’ve been conditioned to see it like that, because the Christmas industrial complex profits off all the presents and cards and booze. The CEOs don’t care if you’re single, divorced, grieving, or just really tired. They have no qualms about making you feel horrible about your lack of cheer.

You don’t have to do it.

You can opt out.

# We have to be alone to be together.

Something strange is happening, especially in American culture. We’re getting more isolated and estranged. And yet, we feel more pressure than ever to bond with each other. We zoom and zoom.

We get nowhere.

Maybe one reason we’re so disconnected is that we’re always connected. We desperately want to be alone, but our devices won’t let us. Our movies and songs won’t let us. Our cultural scripts make us feel ashamed. So we’re always trying to prove how charming we are. We’re tired of each other before we even get into the same room.

I think the answer is to spend more time alone, even during the holidays. For some of us, it’s the only time we get to slow down. Don’t let some wannabe guardian angel put you on a guilt trip.

It’s your time.

Use it how you want.
