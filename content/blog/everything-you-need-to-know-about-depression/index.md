We’ve all heard of depression. Mental health awareness is more prevalent in the 21st-century than it ever has been before, and cases of depression are at an [all-time high](https://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20180511/depression-striking-more-young-people-than-ever#1).

Yet, regardless of the widespread recognition of mental illness, few of us truly understand what depression is, how it affects people and what can be done to alleviate its symptoms.

Indeed, we might know a few facts. We may know that depression is recognised by the presence of intense feelings of sadness, and that sufferers are prone to suicidal ways of thinking.

As far as the specifics go, though, most of us could do with sharpening up our knowledge. Understanding the basics of depression and how it can be treated is essential in a world so heavily plagued by mental illness — in order to protect both ourselves and those around us.

It can be confusing at first, but don’t worry. This article will teach you just about everything you need to know about depression.

# What is Depression?

Most of us feel sad from time-to-time. Sometimes our sadness has a direct cause, but sometimes feelings of sorrow can crop up out of nowhere for reasons unbeknownst to us.

When feelings of hopelessness, helplessness or worthlessness persist for extended periods of time, that might signify more than just a momentary dip in mood. **Those could be the early signs of clinical depression.**

But what exactly *is* clinical depression? Depression is, in essence, a condition characterised by a prolonged disturbance in mood. As [Psychiatry.org](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression) puts it,

> ‘Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.’

For a more personalised view, Matt Haig, long-term depressive and author of the bestselling memoir, ‘Reasons to Stay Alive’, describes depression like this:

> ‘It acts like an intense fear of happiness, even as you yourself consciously want that happiness more than anything.’

Depression, in essence, **makes it incredibly difficult for us to feel happy.**

## The Difference Between Depression and Grief

It’s normal to feel unhappy after a traumatic event, like losing a loved one or being made redundant. Such feelings might not necessarily denote depression, but rather a natural, healthy response to difficult circumstances.

In grief, for instance, **painful emotions tend to come in waves.** Feelings of sadness come and go, and bright, happy moments pierce holes in the black canvas that envelops us after the death of somebody close.

Grief is different to depression, although the two are sometimes mistaken for one other. As [Psychiatry.org](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression) puts it,

> ‘The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities.’

*Memories of those lost come and go, but a person’s self-esteem and sense of purpose usually remain intact at least somewhat when grieving. The same can rarely be said about a person suffering with clinical depression.*

In some cases, though, **grief can bring about depression.** This is sometimes referred to as ‘[complicated grief](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjSkduIpYLkAhUGecAKHZrjAqwQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fcomplicated-grief%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20360374&usg=AOvVaw2E2Nrh_nPcuOD1Y-6mL1ig)’, since the normal, transitory grieving process becomes prolonged.

Again, there is a stark difference between normal grief and complicated grief or depression. As the American Cancer Society writes,

> ‘If the grieving person begins to abuse alcohol or drugs, neglects personal hygiene, develops physical problems, or talks about suicide, it may be a sign of complicated grief or depression.’

Although there is indeed some overlap between the symptoms of grief and depression, the two remain markedly different.

Understanding these differences is important. Mistaking them could lead to a misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.
